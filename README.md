# Uncertainty-Aware Volatility Forecasting of Aluminium

This repository contains the code developed for my MSc thesis *‚ÄúUncertainty-Aware Volatility Forecasting of Aluminium‚Äù*.  
The project was carried out in collaboration with **ChAI**, a company specialising in commodity price forecasting and option premium estimation.

The aim of the thesis is to forecast the **30-day realised volatility of aluminium futures** using both classical econometric models and modern machine learning approaches, with a focus on predictive distributions rather than point forecasts.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **data_processing.ipynb**  
  Notebook for preprocessing and exploratory analysis of the aluminium dataset and exogenous features.

- **GARCH.ipynb**  
  Benchmark econometric model (GARCH(1,1)) including both analytic and Monte Carlo forecasts.

- **GP_exact.ipynb**  
  Gaussian Process models with standard kernels (Mat√©rn, RBF, periodic).

- **gpsig.ipynb**  
  Gaussian Process with Signature Kernel (sparse variational inference using inducing tensors).

- **LSTM_quantile_regression.ipynb**  
  LSTM with quantile regression head for non-parametric distributional forecasting.

- **plots/**  
  Contains figures and metrics generated by the notebooks.

- **\*_less_features / \*_different\_*** notebooks  
  Variants used for ablation studies and robustness checks (e.g. different feature sets, horizons, or lookback lengths).

- **Support code for Signature GP (`.py` files)**  
  - `kernels.py`, `signature_algs.py` ‚Äî kernel and signature path computations  
  - `inducing_variables.py`, `low_rank_calculations.py` ‚Äî sparse variational inference support  
  - `training.py`, `models.py`, `utils.py`, `preprocessing.py`, `lags.py` ‚Äî training utilities and feature engineering functions
